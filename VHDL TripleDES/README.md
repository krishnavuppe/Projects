Task: FPGA Implementation of Triple Data Encryption Standard, the most secured algorithm that replaces famous but crack able DES for secure transactions like credit cards.


3-DES uses 3 64 bit keys and operates on 64 bit plain text to produce 64 bit cipher text.

The Project is developed in VHDL and Simulation & Synthesis is performed on Xilinx ISE. The developed VDHL is implemented on SPARTAN-3 FPGA
