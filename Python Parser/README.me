Task: Generating a new logically equivalent netlist which only uses NAND2 and NOR2 gates, which replace all the different gates that are there already in the verilog input file. 

So this parser.py takes any verilog .v files as input and convert the logic gates mentioned in those .v files into their equivalent NAND and NOR gates realization and produces a out.v file. This out.v file which is generated will produce the same output as the input .v  file does when it is implemented on an FPGA but the difference is that the generated out.v verilog code will be faster compared to the input .v code.
