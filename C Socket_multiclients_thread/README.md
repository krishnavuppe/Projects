Description: A program to solve the equation A^2 + 2B + 6C in a continuous loop. The server waits till three clients are connected and assigns threads to each client. In each loop the server randomly assigns numbers to A, B and C. It sends A to first client, B to second client and C to third client. The clients in return send back the values of A^2, 2B and 6C respectively to the server. The server finally adds them and displays the final result of the equation at the end of the loop.
